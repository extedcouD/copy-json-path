## Quotes

When you use the bracket notation the key is surrounded by quotes. With the `copy-json-path.quote` setting you can choose the type of quotes to use `Single` or `Double`.
The default value is `Double`.

## Output

If you want to change the output format, you can change the `copy-json-path.output` setting.

The default output is only the json path represented by the %PATH% variable.

For example, you can change it as follows:
![Output html](assets/settings-output-html.png 'Output html')

and the result in your clipboard will be :
`<TMPL_VAR NAME="path.to.key">` -->
